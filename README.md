**Requirement**

1. **Choose a Real-World Application**

E-Visa Management System

2. **Project Design with System Diagram**

- We created a System Diagram to show the software and hardware components of the E-Visa Management System. This diagram was used to present the overall architecture of the system.

**3. Backend Development (Node.js + Express + MongoDB)**

- Set up and configure the MongoDB database connection.
- Implement various backend functions for handling application data.Ensure that all functions are compatible with an Application Programming Interface (API) structure(Follow existing patterns used in the Task Manager App where applicable).
- Implement CRUD operations forcreating, reading, updating, and deleting records for each functionality.

4. **Frontend Development (React.js)**

- Create a user-friendly interface to interact with your API endpoint (Follow task manager app).
- Implement different forms for adding, updating, and deleting records.
- Display data using tables, cards, or lists (Follow how we showed data in task manager app, try to implement better visualization for the frontend.)

**5. Authentication & Authorization** (Prerequisite Task)

- Ensure only authenticated users can access and perform CRUD operations. (Already developed in your project)
- Use JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for user authentication (Use the task manager one from .env file).

**6. GitHub Version Control & Branching Strategy**

- Use GitHub for version control and maintain:
- main branch (stable production-ready code)
- Difference branches for each developer
- Follow proper commit messages and pull request (PR) for code reviews.

**7. CI/CD Pipeline Setup**

- Implement a CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions to:
- Automatically run tests on every commit/pull request (Optional).
- Deploy the backend to AWS. (Use the QUT provided EC2 instance)
- Deploy the frontend to AWS.
- Document your CI/CD workflow in the README.

**Submission Requirements**

**A report **contains** the following (Provide screenshots as evidence for each implemented task. **The screenshot should **contain** your username** from JIRA, GITHUB, and AWS**):

- **JIRA Project **Management**(Provide screenshots in the **report o**f at least two epics**, **including user story, sub**t**a**sks**. **Please **donâ€™t** provide **the **U**ser Authentication** epic**.**Provide your JIRA Board URL in the report and README file as well.**Through the JIRA Board, we will systematically review the completeness of the project features, organised under Epics, User Stories, and Sub-tasks.**
- Requirement diagram, Block Definition Diagram (BDD), Parametric Diagram (Using project features).
- **GitHub Repository (backend/ and frontend/)** link. We will **review** your code implementation, which you followed from the task description. We will also **review** your commits, main branch, feature branches, and pull requests. **(**Please note that the authorisation** (Log In, Registration)** is the prerequisite for backend development.**)**
- CI/CD pipeline details step by step screenshot.
- README.md with:
- Project setup instructions.
- Public URL of your project.
- Provide a project-specific username and password if we need to access your dashboard.
